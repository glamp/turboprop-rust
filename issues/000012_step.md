# Step 12: Performance Optimization and Scalability

## Objective

Optimize performance for larger codebases and improve scalability from 50 to 10,000+ files.

## Tasks

1. Profile and optimize embedding generation pipeline
2. Implement parallel processing for file operations
3. Optimize vector similarity search performance
4. Add memory usage optimization for large indices
5. Implement index compression and streaming
6. Add performance benchmarking and monitoring

## Technical Approach

- Use `rayon` for CPU-bound parallel operations
- Memory-mapped files for large index access
- Streaming chunked processing to reduce memory usage
- Vector quantization for index compression
- Batch operations for database-like efficiency

## Dependencies to Add

- `criterion` - Benchmarking framework
- `pprof` - CPU profiling

## Optimization Areas

- Parallel file discovery and reading
- Batch embedding generation (32-64 chunks at once)
- Efficient vector storage with memory mapping
- Lazy loading of index segments
- Compressed vector storage
- Concurrent search processing

## Acceptance Criteria

- Can handle 10,000 files efficiently
- Memory usage scales sublinearly with codebase size
- Search performance remains under 1 second for large indices
- Index creation time scales reasonably (linear or better)
- Parallel processing utilizes all CPU cores effectively
- Memory-mapped index access for large datasets
- Benchmarking shows consistent performance improvements

## Performance Targets

- Index 10,000 files in under 5 minutes
- Search response time < 500ms for large indices
- Memory usage < 1GB for 10,000 file index
- Concurrent indexing and searching without conflicts

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/parallel.rs` - Parallel processing utilities
- `src/compression.rs` - Vector compression algorithms
- `src/streaming.rs` - Memory-efficient streaming operations
- `benches/performance.rs` - Performance benchmarks
- All performance-critical modules - Add optimizations

## Test Cases

- Test with large codebase (sample-codebases/react-use)
- Benchmark indexing performance
- Benchmark search performance
- Test memory usage under load
- Test concurrent access patterns

## Proposed Solution

Based on the current codebase analysis, I will implement the following performance optimizations:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Dependencies
1. Add `criterion` and `pprof` crates to Cargo.toml for benchmarking and profiling
2. Create performance benchmarking framework in `benches/performance.rs`

### Phase 2: Parallel Processing (`src/parallel.rs`)
1. Implement parallel file discovery using `rayon`
2. Add parallel chunking across multiple files simultaneously
3. Implement batch embedding generation (32-64 chunks at once across files)
4. Add CPU-bound operation threading with work-stealing

### Phase 3: Memory Optimization & Compression (`src/compression.rs`)
1. Implement vector quantization for index compression
2. Add streaming index serialization/deserialization
3. Implement memory-mapped vector storage with lazy loading
4. Add index segmentation for large datasets

### Phase 4: Streaming Operations (`src/streaming.rs`)
1. Implement chunked processing pipelines to reduce memory usage
2. Add streaming index building for large codebases
3. Implement buffered I/O with configurable buffer sizes
4. Add progress tracking for long-running operations

### Phase 5: Search Optimization
1. Optimize similarity search with SIMD operations where possible
2. Implement concurrent search processing
3. Add result caching for frequently accessed queries
4. Optimize memory layout for better cache performance

### Performance Validation
1. Benchmark against 10,000 file codebase target
2. Memory profiling to ensure <1GB usage
3. Search latency testing to achieve <500ms response times
4. Parallel processing efficiency testing
