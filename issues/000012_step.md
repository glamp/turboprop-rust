# Step 12: Performance Optimization and Scalability

## Objective

Optimize performance for larger codebases and improve scalability from 50 to 10,000+ files.

## Tasks

1. Profile and optimize embedding generation pipeline
2. Implement parallel processing for file operations
3. Optimize vector similarity search performance
4. Add memory usage optimization for large indices
5. Implement index compression and streaming
6. Add performance benchmarking and monitoring

## Technical Approach

- Use `rayon` for CPU-bound parallel operations
- Memory-mapped files for large index access
- Streaming chunked processing to reduce memory usage
- Vector quantization for index compression
- Batch operations for database-like efficiency

## Dependencies to Add

- `criterion` - Benchmarking framework
- `pprof` - CPU profiling

## Optimization Areas

- Parallel file discovery and reading
- Batch embedding generation (32-64 chunks at once)
- Efficient vector storage with memory mapping
- Lazy loading of index segments
- Compressed vector storage
- Concurrent search processing

## Acceptance Criteria

- Can handle 10,000 files efficiently
- Memory usage scales sublinearly with codebase size
- Search performance remains under 1 second for large indices
- Index creation time scales reasonably (linear or better)
- Parallel processing utilizes all CPU cores effectively
- Memory-mapped index access for large datasets
- Benchmarking shows consistent performance improvements

## Performance Targets

- Index 10,000 files in under 5 minutes
- Search response time < 500ms for large indices
- Memory usage < 1GB for 10,000 file index
- Concurrent indexing and searching without conflicts

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/parallel.rs` - Parallel processing utilities
- `src/compression.rs` - Vector compression algorithms
- `src/streaming.rs` - Memory-efficient streaming operations
- `benches/performance.rs` - Performance benchmarks
- All performance-critical modules - Add optimizations

## Test Cases

- Test with large codebase (sample-codebases/react-use)
- Benchmark indexing performance
- Benchmark search performance
- Test memory usage under load
- Test concurrent access patterns
