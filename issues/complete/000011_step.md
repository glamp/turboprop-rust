# Step 11: Error Handling and Resilience

## Objective
Implement comprehensive error handling and make the system resilient to various failure modes.

## Tasks
1. Add structured error types for all failure modes
2. Implement graceful degradation strategies
3. Add retry logic for transient failures
4. Improve error messages for user-facing scenarios
5. Add error logging and diagnostics
6. Create error handling tests

## Technical Approach
- Use `thiserror` for structured error definitions
- Implement exponential backoff for network operations
- Graceful handling of corrupted index files
- Clear error messages that suggest solutions
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## Dependencies to Add
- `thiserror` - Structured error handling

## Error Scenarios to Handle
- Network failures during model download
- Corrupted or incompatible index files  
- Insufficient disk space for index storage
- Permission issues accessing files or directories
- Invalid git repositories
- Embedding model loading failures
- File encoding issues
- Configuration validation errors

## Acceptance Criteria
- All error conditions have appropriate error types
- User-facing errors include suggested solutions
- Transient failures (network) include retry logic
- Corrupted index files trigger clean rebuild
- File permission errors provide clear guidance
- Network timeouts don't crash the application
- Invalid configurations show specific validation errors
- Error messages are consistent and helpful

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/error.rs` - Centralized error types and handling
- `src/retry.rs` - Retry logic for transient failures
- `src/recovery.rs` - Index recovery and validation
- All existing modules - Add proper error handling
- `tests/error_handling_tests.rs` - Error scenario tests

## Test Cases
- Test network failure recovery
- Test corrupted index recovery
- Test permission error handling
- Test invalid configuration errors
- Test file encoding issue handling
- Test graceful degradation scenarios

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current codebase, I found that it currently uses `anyhow` for basic error handling with `anyhow::bail!()` macros and has some error context utilities. However, it lacks structured error types, retry logic, and comprehensive recovery mechanisms.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Add `thiserror` dependency** to enable structured error definitions
2. **Create `src/error.rs`** - Central error types using `thiserror` for all failure modes:
   - `TurboPropError` enum covering all error scenarios
   - Network failures, file system issues, validation errors, etc.
   - User-friendly error messages with suggested solutions
3. **Create `src/retry.rs`** - Retry logic with exponential backoff:
   - `RetryConfig` for configurable retry behavior
   - `RetryableOperation` trait for operations that can be retried
   - Exponential backoff implementation for network operations
4. **Create `src/recovery.rs`** - Index recovery and validation:
   - Detection of corrupted index files
   - Automatic cleanup and rebuilding strategies
   - Index validation and repair utilities  
5. **Update existing modules** to use structured error types:
   - Replace `anyhow::bail!()` with specific error types
   - Add retry logic to network operations (embeddings, model downloads)
   - Implement graceful degradation where appropriate
6. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Create `tests/error_handling_tests.rs`:
   - Mock failure scenarios and verify error handling
   - Test retry logic with simulated transient failures
   - Test recovery mechanisms with corrupted data
   - Verify user-facing error messages are helpful

### Key Features
- **Structured Error Types**: Replace generic `anyhow::Error` with specific, actionable error types
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for network operations with configurable limits
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic detection and repair of corrupted index files
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Error messages include suggested solutions and next steps
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating when possible, degrades gracefully when not
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured error logging for debugging and diagnostics
