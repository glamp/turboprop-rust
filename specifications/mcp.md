# MCP Server
I want to simple mcp server that will:
- automatically index a repo. watch that repo for changes to update the index.
- expose a `search` tool over that repo's index. should expose the different flags (i.e. `--filter`, `--filetype`) as tool arguments.
- keep it very simple. i do not want you to suggest/scope creep this.
- it should work with Claude Code and GitHub Copilot. provide clear instructions in the README
